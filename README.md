# ED Staffing Board (Vite + TypeScript)

This is a minimal rebuild of the ED Staffing Board using a modern toolchain.
It uses Vite for development, TypeScript for type safety and vanilla DOM APIs
for the UI.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the dev server
- `npm run build` – build for production
- `npm test` – run unit tests
